Web Programming with Python and JavaScript
a description about this project (Project 0)
This whole week has been crazy, moving in and getting over the jet lag.
So honostly, I just made sure to meet the requirment of this site as I onlt got the chance to work on it just few hours before the deadline.
I am taking other classes here and moving in and adjusting is only now under control.
I'll be more creative for the upcoming projects, but as for this one, I just dealt with it as a checklist (do this and that).
nonetheless, I created it myself.
Regards :)
